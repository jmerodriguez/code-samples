# Code Samples

Welcome to my GitHub code samples' page.

Here, you will see an extract of what I can do in R.

All the necessary files that you need for running the R scripts and Rmd files are included in this Repo, so no further action is needed from you.

What you will find in the code samples:

**R sample folder.** You will get a small taste of my **web scraping and sentiment analysis** skills. This file parses quarterly reports from the Bank of International Settlements (BIS), a financial institution in Switzerland that produces research and reports focusing on central banks and the global economy.

**Awesome interactive visualization in R.** Sophisticated **interactive plots in Shiny**.
The app uses data from the US Census Bureau to map US states' socioeconomic variables and their relation to Medicaid affiliation rates. The app is a modified version of my final project for the course Data & Programming II (Prof. Jeffrey Levy) at the Harris School of Public Policy.


Enjoy!
