# Code Samples

Welcome to my GitHub code samples' page.

Here, you will see an extract of what I can do in R, Python, and Stata.

All the necessary files that you need for running the R scripts are included in this Repo, so no further action is needed from you.

What you will find in the code samples:

**R sample folder.** You will get a small taste of my **web scraping and sentiment analysis** skills. This file parses quarterly reports from the Bank of International Settlements (BIS), a financial institution in Switzerland that produces research and reports focusing on central banks and the global economy.

**Awesome interactive visualization in Shiny.** Find the R code for a sophisticated **interactive plots in Shiny**, which is available at https://jmerodriguez.shinyapps.io/ACS-interactive/  
The app uses data from the American Community Survey (US Census Bureau) to map US states' socioeconomic variables and their relation to Medicaid affiliation rates. The app is a modified version of my final project for the course Data & Programming II (Prof. Jeffrey Levy) at the Harris School of Public Policy.

**Python sample folder.** Short code showing my Pandas skills. The code uses a subsample of Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA) to calculate and analyze unemployment rates around the World.

**Stata sample folder.** You will find a do-file in which I plot female primary school enrollment percentage by World Bank Region between 2010 and 2017. You will see here that I can, among other things, code loops, merge datasets and, of course, plot!

Enjoy!
